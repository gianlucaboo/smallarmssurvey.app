                A national C-IED enterprise is often engaged in an <strong>action-reaction-counteraction cycle with an IED system.</strong> It is for this reason, why maintaining an updated IED threat picture is essential and requires <strong>on-going timely information sharing</strong> between all C-IED stakeholders.<br>Information sharing between C-IED stakeholders is a key enabler to success in efforts to at least match
                but ideally overmatch the threat posed.
