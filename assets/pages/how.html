              An <strong>understanding of IED employment methods</strong> is necessary to inform what must be implemented to counter them and support optimised risk mitigation. IED&nbsp;employment methods can be considered on the <strong>strategic, tactical, and operational levels.</strong>

              IEDs are a tactical asymmetric weapon system with strategic impact, being an excellent weapon of irregular or hybrid warfare, which supports the intention to destroy an opponentâ€™s political will to fight.

              At an operational level examining how IEDs are employed involves an examination of the IED system which considers the network, processes and material involved in IED attacks and is then related to their modus operandi, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, constraints and limitations.

              The tactical characterisation of an IED attack provides context for how a specific device is used or intended to be used. The methods of employment of IEDs vary depending on the intended effect that an IED threat actor wants to achieve along with the constraints they face due to the C-IED efforts implemented.
